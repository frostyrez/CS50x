-- Humphrey Street bakery. Interviews were conducted today

--  I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
--  If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to
--  look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                          |

--  but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived
--  at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the
--  thief there withdrawing some money.                                                                                                 |
-- | 163 | Raymond | 2021 | 7     | 28  | As the thief was leaving the bakery,
-- they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
-- I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out
-- of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of
-- the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |
